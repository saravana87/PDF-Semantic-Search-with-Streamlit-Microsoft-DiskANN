PDF Semantic Search with Streamlit & Microsoft DiskANN
This project is a simple web app that lets you upload any PDF and search it by meaning (not just keywords) using AI. It uses Microsoft DiskANN for ultra-fast vector search, making it perfect for large documents.

Features
Upload any PDF and extract the text

Split text into sentences and create embeddings with a pre-trained AI model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Build a fast search index using Microsoft DiskANN

Instantly search your PDF by meaning, not just exact words

How It Works
Upload a PDF: Drag and drop or choose your file.

Text Extraction: The app reads all the text from your PDF.

Sentence Embeddings: Each sentence is converted into a vector using a pre-trained AI model.

Indexing with DiskANN: Vectors are indexed using Microsoft DiskANN for lightning-fast search.

Semantic Search: Type any questionâ€”find the most relevant sentences, even if the words are different!
